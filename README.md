# Google Book Search

> Have you ever known what you wanted to read about, but couldn't find a perfect book for your preferred subject? The Google Book Search application utilizes the Google Books API to allow users to type in a search and be presented with books. If users are interested in a book they find, they can open it on Google Books for more information, or save it to a list of favorite books.

## Description

The Google Book Search app allows a user to type in a search value, and then they are presented with a list of books that match the search value provided. If a user likes the book, they can click on the "View" button to view more about the book on the Google Books website, or the "Save" button to save it to a list of favorites. When users click on the tab for "Saved Books", they can access their list of saved favorites, view the books on Google Books, or delete a book from their list of favorites. This application uses Node.js, React.js, MongoDB, Mongoose, Express, Axios, Nodemon, and Material-UI CSS Framework to function.
